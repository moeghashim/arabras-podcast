In this episode of ARAB RAS, Moe and Tariq discussed Al Far3i’s journey becoming a musician in the Arab world. How he started, the challenges he faced and the decisions he made. They talked about how is Al Far3i’s music reflects his character and personality which is not something common in the Arab world. In Al Far3i’s opinion, most of the artists don’t really have a message to deliver, to help the people understand their own character.

Tariq made it clear that his music is bout self-expression, communicate with people through something that they can relate to, their language, daily life, struggles, politics, love, but also entertain them. They also discussed the common belief that doing music needs a qualified musician who studied the subject, while many of talented individuals don’t tend to take the risk. Al Far3i explained the difference between making music, releasing music for just listening and performing music. As well as the independence and courage of artists that don’t relate to any official platform, their magnificent ability to brand themselves and spread their music among fellow humans using social media away from official institutions and platforms. Tariq spoke about the steps he took in order to achieve his goals, the opportunities and the collaborations, including the [47Soul](http://47soul.com/), a band that he is currently a member of. 

47Soul started in a way different from any other band, that it was a project joined up already well-known artists going through similar experiences and challenges. Tariq explained how is 47Soul is different from his work individually as he’s targeting the Arab community locally while 47Soul targeting people internationally and speaks to the whole world. 

47Soul represents the beauty of collaborations when people share the same values, beliefs and goals and then the great value of things created together.
